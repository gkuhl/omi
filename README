Description
===========
The OMI Python package is an implementation of a gridding
algorithm to project measurements of the Ozone Monitoring
Instrument (OMI) from the instrumentâ€™s frame of reference
to a longitude-latitude grid.

The algorithm is described in the following paper. Please
cite the it, if you use this software in your work:
  G. Kuhlmann, A. Hartl, H. M. Cheung, Y. F. Lam, and
  M. O. Wenig: A novel gridding algorithm to create 
  regional trace gas maps from satellite observations, 
  Atmos. Meas. Tech. Discuss., 6, 7867-7910, 
  http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/amtd-6-7867-2013, 2013.


Requirements
============
- python 2.5 (or higher, not 3.x)
- numpy
- scipy
- h5py

- cython (only if C code shall be created from *.pyx)
- matplotlib (only for plotting)
- basemap (only for plotting)


Installing
==========
1) unzip "tar -xvf omi-X.Y.Z.tar.gz"
2) cd into "omi-X.Y.Z"
3) run "python setup.py build" 
4) run "python setup.py install"
   or "python setup.py install --prefix=~/local" 


Documentation
=============
The package provides functions for created Level 3 data using 
either constant values or parabolic splines. An example script
for OMI tropospheric NO2 column densities is provided in the
example folder.
