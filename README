Description
===========
The OMI Python package is an implementation of a gridding algorithm
to project measurements of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)
from the instrumentâ€™s frame of reference to a longitude-latitude
grid.

The algorithm is described in the following paper. Please
cite the it, if you use this software in your work:

Kuhlmann, G., Hartl, A., Cheung, H. M., Lam, Y. F., and
Wenig, M. O.: A novel gridding algorithm to create regional
trace gas maps from satellite observations, Atmos. Meas. Tech.,
7, 451-467, doi:10.5194/amt-7-451-2014, 2014.


Requirements
============
- python 2.5 (or higher, not 3.x)
- numpy
- scipy
- h5py

- cython (only if C code shall be created from *.pyx)
- matplotlib (only for plotting)
- basemap (only for plotting)


Installing
==========
1) You can download the directory containing the source code using
the git clone command. Type:

    git clone https://github.com/gkuhl/omi

(If you don't have "git" installed on your computer, you can also
download the source code using the "Download ZIP" button on the
GitHub website.)

2) "cd" into the directory created by "git".

3) To build the C code in the package run

    python setup.py build

This requires a C compiler and "cython". If you don't want to use
"cython", please modify the "setup.py" file by changing

    USE_CYTHON = True

to

    USE_CYTHON = False


4) To finish the installation run

    python setup.py install

If you want to install the package locally, e.g. in "~/local", you
can use the "--prefix" option:

    python setup.py install --prefix=~/local


5) To test the installation, you can try the example script
"OMNO2_Trop.py". Please note that you have to download the OMI NO2
and PIXCOR data at 

    http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI

to run the example. Please read the example script for details.


Documentation
=============
The package provides functions for created Level 3 data using  either
constant values or parabolic splines. An example script for OMI
tropospheric NO2 column densities is provided in the example folder.
Please read the description in the example script ("OMNO2_Trop.py")
and the docstrings in the source code for detailed information.
